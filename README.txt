How to use the application:

1.To run the program, make sure you have installed Blender from the Microsoft Store (even if you have already installed it from some other source, this step is important)

2.Run Helsinki3D+ Cityloader.exe (inside the Helsinki3D+ cityloader folder)

3.Pan around the map using the mouse, zoom using the scrollwheel

4.Select an area to download by clicking the "Crop" buttom in the bottom right side of the screen

5.Select the two corners of the area you want to download on the map

6.You can select a level of detail setting on the right. Automatic is on by default and is recommended.

7.Click confirm to start the download and processing of the area. Soon a folder with your .stl 3D model will open. If not, you can also find it in the results folder, provided there were no errors

8.If you want to print the 3D model, just open it in a Slicer (Such as Ultimaker Cura), slice it, and 3D print it

This is a demo version, though most issues have been ironed out.
